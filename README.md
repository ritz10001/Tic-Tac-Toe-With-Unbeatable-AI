# Tic-Tac-Toe-With-Unbeatable-AI
This is an attempt to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game with two primary options: a CPU that chooses random squares to play or a smart AI that is technically unbeatable thanks to the minimax algorithm.

I wanted to give myself a challenege not particularly too long, but a fairly difficult one. I believe the implementation I used was rather unconventional in the way I used and implemented different functions. Nevertheless, I believe I learned quite a bit more about object-oriented programming since I used C#. I also believe I garnered a good amount of knowledge on how the "tree" data structure works through this project.

I also used different console colors to make the theme look a bit hackery. You can check that out for yourself by executing it on the command line, or see the pictures I have attached. There are no additional installations you need to do!

To execute, go inside the TicTacToe folder in File Explorer and click the directory. Replace the directly with "cmd" without the quotation marks and hit enter. Once the command prompt opens up, just type the simple command: dotnet run.

I believe this program shouldn't have any bugs since I tried to fix any that came along the way.

I hope you enjoy it!

Here are some pictures of what you can expect:
