# Tic-Tac-Toe-With-Unbeatable-AI
This is an attempt to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game with two primary options: a CPU that chooses random squares to play or a smart AI that is technically unbeatable thanks to the minimax algorithm. However, as of now, the AI portion of this project has not been implemented yet as I am still working on understanding it before coding it.

With that being said, the remaining part of the project was made completely by myself without using any help, which I am happy about. I believe the implementation I used was rather slightly unconventional in the way I used and implemented different functions. Nevertheless, I believe I learnt quite a bit more about object-oriented programming since I used C#.

I also used different console colors to make the theme look a bit hackery. You can check that out for yourself by executing it in the command line, or see the pictures I have attached. There are no additional installations you need to do!

To execute, go inside the TicTacToe folder in file explorer and click the directory. Replace the directly with "cmd" without the quotations and hit enter. Once command prompt opens up, just type the simple command: dotnet run. 

Also, keep in mind that is NOT the final version, which means that there might still be a few bugs here and there. But I believe there shouldn't be any.

Here are some pictures of what you can expect (for now) :
