# Tic-Tac-Toe-With-Unbeatable-AI
This is an attempt to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game with two primary options: a CPU which chooses random squares to play or a smart AI that is technically unbeatable, thanks to the minimax algorithm. However, as for now, the AI portion of this project has not been implemented yet as I am still trying to understand it before coding it.
